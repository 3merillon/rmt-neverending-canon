# RMT Neverending Canon

A mathematical implementation of J.S. Bach's Neverending Canon using Relative Music Theory (RMT). This is the first truly neverending version, using pure frequency ratios to ensure the base note will never be an octave of a previous one until the end of the universe.

## Overview

This application demonstrates the power of Relative Music Theory by implementing Bach's "Neverending Canon" in a mathematically pure way. Unlike traditional 12-tone equal temperament versions, this implementation uses precise frequency ratios to create an eternally ascending progression that never truly repeats.

## Features

- Real-time frequency generation using pure mathematical ratios
- Visual representation of notes with frequency ratios
- Interactive viewport navigation
- Tempo control
- Base frequency adjustment
- Playhead tracking
- Past iteration visualization

## Technology

- Pure JavaScript
- Web Audio API
- TapSpace.js for viewport management
- BigFraction.js for precise mathematical calculations
